# About

This is a tutorial on how to run this repository, assuming a blank copy of Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS.

The level of this document is low-intermediate for any Linux user.

Please choose the steps that you need, should you like to speed-up the setup process.

Technology stack is: MySQL (Maria fork) for database, Spring-Boot for the backend, and React.js for the front-end service.

Everything will be done with the Chrome browser given the CORS plugin that works out-of-box.

## Main Setup

$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade

### Git and clone

$ sudo apt-get install git

$ git clone https://github.com/olejardamir/macheteOrder.git


### Lamp stack with phpmyadmin (admin/admin has all SQL privileges)


$ sudo apt install apache2

$ sudo apt install mariadb-server mariadb-client

$ sudo apt install php php-common php-mysql php-gd php-cli 

$ sudo apt install phpmyadmin

[select apache, format db, and enter your db password to use]

$ sudo systemctl restart apache2

$ sudo mysql -u root -p


MariaDB [(none)]> CREATE USER 'admin'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'admin';

MariaDB [(none)]> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON \*.\* TO 'admin'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;

MariaDB [(none)]> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

MariaDB [(none)]> exit

### Database Setup

[You can do this from phpmyadmin, or follow the steps below to load the starwars.sql]

$ cd macheteOrder/

$ sudo mysql -u root -p

MariaDB [(none)]> CREATE DATABASE starwars;

MariaDB [dbname]> USE starwars;

MariaDB [(none)]> exit

$ mysql -u admin -p starwars < starwars.sql

### Java and Maven

$ sudo apt-get install maven

$ sudo apt install default-jdk

### React.js
$ sudo apt install curl

$ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo -E bash -

$ sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

$ sudo npm install -g create-react-app

$ cd ~/macheteOrder/machete_frontend

$ sudo chown -R $USER:$(id -gn $USER) /home/YOUR_HOME_DIR/.config

$ npm install

$ npm run

[if it doesn't start: https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/3690]

$ sudo rm -R node_modules

$ npm install

$ npm start

### Backend project setup and run
[Open a new terminal window or tab while react is running]

$ cd ~/macheteOrder/machete/machete

[edit the target release from 1.11 to 1.8]

$ nano pom.xml

[locate <java.version>1.11</java.version> and change to <java.version>1.8</java.version>]

^x y

$ mvn clean install

$ mvn spring-boot:run

## React Setup and Run

### Chrome and CORS
[go to https://www.google.com/chrome/ and download and run/install the deb package]

[install CORS plugin in Chrome https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-cors-access-control/lhobafahddgcelffkeicbaginigeejlf?hl=en]

# Final Application Run
Go to http://localhost:8080/ (in Chrome)

Press the CORS plugin button (upper right corner) to activate it

Reload

# General Overview of the Spring Boot Functions
The SQL schemas are empty. The provided APIs are used to scrape the data into SQL for the further usage. Spring Boot has provided us with the function evoked as ... in order to run anything we want as soon as the Beans are established and before the application starts. This has several advantages and disadvantages. For example, advantage is that we need to call the APIs in only one session and never again. This is good if there is a usage limit, security, etc. The disadvantage is not being able to get any updated information as soon as the updates happen, while updating may be a costly procedure. Since the Films, Titles, and Actors as well as IMDB id-key will never change and remain static, having the scrape is proper in this case.

# General Overview of the Database Tables
No extra data or columns were entered. All tables are in NF1 given the simplicity of a task that we are performing. Furthermore, there is no need for any further normalization since it would simply complicate the queries and slow-down the processing as well as the production. Also, it is worth mentioning that all the id-s are auto-incremented and timestamps generated by the SQL as UTC Linux Timestamp rather than having to pass this data from the front or the back-end (and cause potential issues that can arise from the time-zones, date-formats, etc).

There are 3 tables. One table (films) represents the scraped data, other (queries) represents the actions the user performed, and third table (favourites) represents the saved favourite films that user chose from the UI.

Each time we sort/toggle the order of the films, the request is recorded in the history. Furthermore, we also record user selecting their favourite film as an action as well as the favourite film to be entered in a database.

In order to get as much data as we can, we are not updating the favourite film, but keeping a track of the whole history. The last film can be always obtained by getting an ascending order of an IP address according to a table id, and limiting the result to 1. This, however, has not been implemented since the specifications did not ask us to do it.

# General Overview of the React.js Functions

The React template has been taken from a secondary source in order to speed up the development. Nevertheless, there were some major issues with React and axios not making the requests properly, and it is explained under the "Warnings, and improvements for the future release" section.

# Warnings, and improvements for the future release

- Please note, only those functions that have been assigned have been developed, otherwise, it would not be following the assigned task(s). Furthermore, we were asked to list the characters, while instead, we had to list the actors (this error has been confirmed via e-mail).

- The main issue with this code is React's inability to send the proper POST and PUT request while working with Spring Boot. Requests to Spring Boot have been tested with a PostMan, with the same headers, and Spring Boot did not complain and throw error messages like it did with React. This has been solved by using "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" header with the axios (same issue was happening with fetch) and using POST instead of a PUT. The result is very ugly since we are getting the string withing a Spring Boot that is not in JSON format and that needs to be re-formatted. Again, this is an issue with React.js !

- While running the react application, we may be getting a message regarding the two very low potential security issues. For the purpose of this project, it can be tolerated, however, in the real production this should not be the case.

- While running the Spring Boot, we get a warning which is caused by the java language version being too high (if java 11 is used).

- While running the application and saving the user's favourite film, we are not displaying the favourite film once the user re-visits the page. This is not a part of the assignment, but can be improved in the future.

- Instead of relying on the IP address, we can use cookies to remember the users.

- Log4j implementation should be done too.

- The test-cases using Mockito were not necessary since we would be testing the call and not the results of a call because those results would have been mocked. Therefore, it made no sense to do it but we could make the front-end test cases with Selenium.
