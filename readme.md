This is a tutorial on how to run this repository, assuming a blank copy of Ubuntu.

The level of this document is intermediate.

Please choose the steps that you need, should you like to speed-up the setup process.

Technology stack is: MySQL (Maria fork) for database, Spring-Boot for the backend, and React.js for the front-end service.

Everything will be done with the Chrome browser given the CORS plugin that works out-of-box.
